Data Definition

    WHEELS_OFF Time - The time point that the aircraft's wheels leave the ground.
    WHEELS_ON Time - The time point that the aircraft's wheels touch on the ground.
    TAXI_OUT Time - The time duration elapsed between departure from the origin airport gate and wheels off.
    TAXI_IN Time - The time duration elapsed between wheels-on and gate arrival at the destination airport.
    AIR_TIME - The time duration between wheels_off and wheels_on time.

Data Relationship

    arrival_time = wheels_on + taxi_in
    arrival_delay = arrival_time - scheduled_arrival
    departure_time = wheels_off - taxi_out
    departure_delay = departure_time - scheduled_departure
    elapsed_time =air_time + taxi_in + taxi_out
    air_time = wheels_on - wheels_off

Note:

In the flights file, there are around 480k flights with original_airport & destination_airport being a 5-digit number ('14168')
instead of three-character code ('LAX').
